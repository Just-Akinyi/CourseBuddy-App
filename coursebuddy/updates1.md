Add web-specific meta tags for PWA behavior (manifest, theme color, icons, etc.)

Example:

<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json" />
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff" />
<meta name="description" content="CourseBuddy PWA" />


This helps browsers treat your app as an installable PWA with offline support.

web/firebase-messaging-sw.js

This is the Firebase Messaging Service Worker to handle background notifications on web.

Without this, FCM background messages won‚Äôt work on web.

Example minimal content:

importScripts('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.6.1/firebase-app-compat.js');
importScripts('https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.6.1/firebase-messaging-compat.js');

firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: "...",
  authDomain: "...",
  projectId: "...",
  messagingSenderId: "...",
  appId: "..."
});

const messaging = firebase.messaging();

messaging.onBackgroundMessage(function(payload) {
  console.log('[firebase-messaging-sw.js] Received background message ', payload);
  const notificationTitle = payload.notification.title;
  const notificationOptions = {
    body: payload.notification.body,
  };
  self.registration.showNotification(notificationTitle, notificationOptions);
});


Routing / Deep linking

For deep link support, make sure your AuthGate or routing solution handles URL paths correctly.

On web, you might want to configure the URL strategy to remove the hash (#) from URLs using setPathUrlStrategy() from url_strategy package.

Example:

import 'package:url_strategy/url_strategy.dart';

void main() {
  setPathUrlStrategy();
  ...
}

i want a very flat database very easy to scale
avoid suto ids
ask permission before overwritting id's in the database

Teacher Access ability to create and edit content vs. Admin Supervision admin can oversee all of the content created by teachers.a dashboard where the admin can view, approve, or remove content. 
no duplicates for ids for teachers there is edit button on top of___ nitesand it sends to admin for aproval then there is a small status widget that is not clickable very small on top of teachers sent content that marks waiting for aproval or approved if approved it means it will be sent to update the existing or if rejected sends notification to teacher they also receive notification from top of their screen if approved
we use slug-style from title for ids
